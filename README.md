# Molecular Dynamics/X-ray Coherent Scattering

This repository contains code for the Python package `mdxcs`, an acronym for `m`olecular `d`ynamics/`x`-ray `c`oherent `s`cattering. The package provides code to compute coherent X-ray scattering intensities from molecular dynamics trajectories. Please note this package is under active development.
