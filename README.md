# Molecular Dynamics--X-ray Solution Scattering

This repository contains code for the Python package `mdxss`, an acronym for `m`olecular `d`ynamics--`x`-ray `s`olution `s`cattering. The package provides code to compute coherent X-ray scattering intensities from molecular dynamics trajectories. Please note this package is under active development.

*N.B.* 'solution' is our bias; the code would work equally-well for any molecular dynamics simulation.
